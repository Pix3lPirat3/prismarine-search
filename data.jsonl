{"type": "QA","q":"How can I map a Minecraft protocol number to its corresponding version in JavaScript?","a":"To map a Minecraft protocol number to its corresponding version in JavaScript, you can utilize the 'minecraft-data' package. It includes a mapping from protocol numbers to Minecraft versions. For instance, `require('minecraft-data').versionsByMinecraftVersion['pc'][47]` will provide you with the version information for protocol 47. Refer to the documentation for more details: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data#usage","f":"p"}
{"type": "EXPLAIN","q":"How does the 'minecraft-data' package behave when required with or without specifying a version?","a":"When you require the 'minecraft-data' package without specifying a version, you receive a function that can be invoked with a version argument to obtain data for that specific version. The function also has properties for mapping protocol versions, such as 'versionsByMinecraftVersion'. For example, `require('minecraft-data')(47).version` retrieves the data for protocol 47, while `require('minecraft-data').versionsByMinecraftVersion['pc'][47]` returns the version string for that protocol.","f":"p"}
{"type": "CONCEPT","q":"How do I access the latest protocol and Minecraft version information in 'minecraft-data'?","a":"To access the most recent protocol and Minecraft version information in the 'minecraft-data' package, you can use the following code: `require('minecraft-data').versions.pc[0];`.

{"type": "DEBUG","q":"Why is setInterval not behaving as expected in my Mineflayer bot code?","a":"The `setInterval(callback, delay)` function repeatedly calls the callback every `delay` milliseconds. If you need to schedule a single delayed action, use `setTimeout(callback, delay)` instead. Mineflayer relies on standard JavaScript timing functions for scheduling.","f":"p"}
{"type": "QA","q":"Can a Mineflayer bot build structures from schematic files?","a":"Yes, you can use the 'prismarine-schematic' module to read schematic files and then program the Mineflayer bot to construct the structure layer by layer, similar to a 3D printer building from the bottom up.","f":"p"}
{"type": "QA","q":"How can I integrate a Discord bot with Minecraft to execute commands and send logs?","a":"To integrate a Discord bot with Minecraft, you can use discord.js to create the bot and Mineflayer to interact with the Minecraft server. Here's a basic example:\njs\nconst Discord = require('discord.js');\nconst client = new Discord.Client();\nclient.login('your_discord_token');\nclient.on('message', (msg) => {\n  if(msg.channel.id !== 'your_channel_id') return;\n  bot.chat(msg.content);\n});\n\nConsider using dotenv to securely manage your token.","f":"p"}
{"type": "QA","q":"How can I check the server status (online or offline) if the query is set to false?","a":"You can use the 'mc-ping' method from the node-minecraft-protocol library: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/node-minecraft-protocol/blob/master/docs/API.md#mcpingoptions. This method works similarly to how the client checks server status in the server list, and it should work even if the server query is disabled.","f":"p"}
