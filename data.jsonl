{"type": "QA","q":"How can I map a Minecraft protocol number to its corresponding version in JavaScript?","a":"To map a Minecraft protocol number to its corresponding version in JavaScript, you can utilize the 'minecraft-data' package. It includes a mapping from protocol numbers to Minecraft versions. For instance, `require('minecraft-data').versionsByMinecraftVersion['pc'][47]` will provide you with the version information for protocol 47. Refer to the documentation for more details: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data#usage","f":"p"}
{"type": "EXPLAIN","q":"How does the 'minecraft-data' package behave when required with or without specifying a version?","a":"When you require the 'minecraft-data' package without specifying a version, you receive a function that can be invoked with a version argument to obtain data for that specific version. The function also has properties for mapping protocol versions, such as 'versionsByMinecraftVersion'. For example, `require('minecraft-data')(47).version` retrieves the data for protocol 47, while `require('minecraft-data').versionsByMinecraftVersion['pc'][47]` returns the version string for that protocol.","f":"p"}
{"type": "CONCEPT","q":"How do I access the latest protocol and Minecraft version information in 'minecraft-data'?","a":"To access the most recent protocol and Minecraft version information in the 'minecraft-data' package, you can use the following code: `require('minecraft-data').versions.pc[0];`.
