{"type": "QA","q":"How can I map a Minecraft protocol number to its corresponding version in JavaScript?","a":"To map a Minecraft protocol number to its corresponding version in JavaScript, you can utilize the 'minecraft-data' package. It includes a mapping from protocol numbers to Minecraft versions. For instance, `require('minecraft-data').versionsByMinecraftVersion['pc'][47]` will provide you with the version information for protocol 47. Refer to the documentation for more details: https://github.com/PrismarineJS/minecraft-data#usage","f":"p"}
{"type": "EXPLAIN","q":"How does the 'minecraft-data' package behave when required with or without specifying a version?","a":"When you require the 'minecraft-data' package without specifying a version, you receive a function that can be invoked with a version argument to obtain data for that specific version. The function also has properties for mapping protocol versions, such as 'versionsByMinecraftVersion'. For example, `require('minecraft-data')(47).version` retrieves the data for protocol 47, while `require('minecraft-data').versionsByMinecraftVersion['pc'][47]` returns the version string for that protocol.","f":"p"}
{"type": "CONCEPT","q":"How do I access the latest protocol and Minecraft version information in 'minecraft-data'?","a":"To access the most recent protocol and Minecraft version information in the 'minecraft-data' package, you can use the following code: `require('minecraft-data').versions.pc[0];`.

{"type": "QA","q":"How does mineflayer-pathfinder handle pathfinding to distant points, especially with unloaded chunks?","a":"Mineflayer-pathfinder calculates a path to the target using currently loaded chunks. If the target is beyond loaded chunks, it will path as close as possible. As new chunks load, the pathfinder recalculates the path to include these chunks. This only works with the setGoal method; the goto method requires the target to be within loaded chunks. The pathfinder cannot distinguish between a path being unreachable due to a search timeout or genuinely being inaccessible, especially in large search areas. Baritone offers a similar feature, creating partial paths and extending them as new chunks load, but this can result in backtracking or detours due to incomplete initial data.","f":"p"}
